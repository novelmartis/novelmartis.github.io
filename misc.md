- Installing LaTeX on a Mac (14/05/2023)
  - Install [MacTex via Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/mactex)
  - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install 'LaTeX' and 'LaTeX Workshop' extensions in VS Code and restart VS Code

<!-- - [Running Tensorboard through a remote server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37987839/how-can-i-run-tensorboard-on-a-remote-server)
  - The first solution works wonderfully (14/12/17)
  - The [Tensorboard tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) is pretty understandable. Basically, create summaries, initialise FileWriters with directories, and write the summaries during training.
  - If you get the error "locale.Error: unsupported locale setting", while attempting to run Tensorboard, the first solution mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14547631/python-locale-error-unsupported-locale-setting) would help.
  - If you get the error "Tried to connect to port 6006, but address is in use", you can either try to [kill](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ps-kill-and-nice-to-manage-processes-in-linux) Tensorboard or you can switch to another port (say 8008), by doing something like "ssh -L 16006:127.0.0.1:8008 xx@xxxx" and access tensorboard on your local machine at "127.0.0.1:16006/" -->

- [Installing Jekyll for creating a website](https://x-team.com/blog/build-a-free-website-with-jekyll-and-github-pages/)
	- If your website is configured to an older version of Jekyll, you might not use the bundler and use 'jekyll serve' alone. In that case, refer to [this issue](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io/issues/62). After that, manually install all the packages jekyll says are missing by using 'gem install jekyll-x', where x is the package of interest (e.g. archives)
  - If you want to make a page other than the Blog your homepage, check [this discussion](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/289).
  - If you are having trouble with ruby or jekyll (if "jekyll -v" throws an error), you might want to perform a clean install of homebrew to jekyll. You can do so with [this script](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop)
