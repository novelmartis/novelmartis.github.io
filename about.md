Ciao! This is **Sushrut Thorat**'s personal webpage.<br> Now that you are here, I assume you want to know about me.

Let's start with the academic introduction:

* Masters student in Cognitive Neuroscience
  + At [CIMeC](http://web.unitn.it/en/cimec "Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences"), University of Trento, Italy
  + Onwards to the second year
  + Currently working with the [Peelen lab](https://sites.google.com/site/peelenlab/).
* Research interests:
  + The properties of information representation in the brain
  + The nature of personal identity and subjective experience
  + Biological Neural Nets equivalent to Artificial Neural Nets
  + Unsupervised Learning in Artificial Neural Nets
  
Further academically-relevant information can be found in my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-full.pdf). I am currently working on projects related to my research interests. The [projects page]({{site.url}}/projects/) contains short summaries of my past and current projects. My publications and preprints can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=MPFzJQgAAAAJ&hl=en).

  In case you were wondering, martis - i am srt (that's my full name).

Now, about the blog. I'll blog about the green screens of my projects, half-baked but interesting ideas, and other random stuff which might come in handy. To keep things organised, I'll tag the posts. 

I occasionally write short stories and poems. They can be found at [Meadows](https://novelmartiswrites.wordpress.com). I don't make any claims about their "beauty" though.

  A quote which appeals to me in all situations - <br>
  "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee; rumble, young man. Rumble." ~ <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165">M. Ali</a>
