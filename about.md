Ciao! This is **Sushrut Thorat**'s personal webpage.<br> Now that you are here, I assume you want to know about me.

Let's start with the academic introduction:

* Doctoral candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience
    + At the [Donders Centre for Cognition](http://www.ru.nl/donders/ "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour"), Radboud University, The Netherlands
    + Working at the [Peelen Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/peelenlab/)
* Research interests:
    + The neural mechanisms behind the deployment and control of visual attention 
    + The principles of information representation in the brain
    + The nature of personal identity and subjective experience
    + Unsupervised Learning in Artificial Neural Nets

I have a Masters degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from [CIMeC](http://web.unitn.it/en/cimec "Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences"), University of Trento. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Physics from [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). <br>
([QIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information) and [GR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) are awesome, but so is the brain which understands them!)

Further academically-relevant information can be found in my [curriculum vitae (CV)]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-full.pdf). I am currently working on projects related to my research interests. The [projects page]({{site.url}}/projects/) contains brief summaries of my past and current projects. My publications and preprints can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=MPFzJQgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Now, about the blog. I'll blog about the green screens of my projects, half-baked but interesting ideas, and other random stuff which might come in handy.

I occasionally write short stories and poems. They can be found at [Meadows](https://novelmartiswrites.wordpress.com). Don't expect much though!
