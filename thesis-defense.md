<b> <u>Summary of the thesis:</u> </b> ([Extended version][summary])<br>
We can easily find a banana in the kitchen. On the other hand, multiplying two large numbers feels more difficult. However, in recreating these possibilities in machines, we found that it is easier to program multiplication than visual search. This is a testament to the complexity of the brain processes that underlie our search capabilities. Here we present new insights into our understanding of these processes on two fronts: first, our ability to search for targets in parallel in the field of view, and second, our ability to group objects that occur simultaneously and simplify the search. Using neuroimaging (fMRI), we found processes in the brain associated with searches for human bodies (besides faces) running parallel across the visual field. Using behavioral experiments, we found that we can learn simultaneous events between distractor forms, leading to efficient target search. The implications of these findings and follow-ups are discussed.
