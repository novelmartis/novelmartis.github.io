The books below aren’t essential to crack JEE Advanced. But if you’re bored with the standard drill, they can reignite your interest and widen your taste for the subject. Many students in the very top batches in Kota (I was one of them) read books like these.

## Physics
1. **Problems in General Physics — Irodov**  
   If you can solve these, JEE Advanced Physics becomes easy; what remains is speed, built via MCQ practice.
2. **Fundamentals of Physics — Halliday, Resnick, Walker**  
   Consider this your physics textbook.
3. **The Feynman Lectures on Physics — Feynman**  
   If you want to *enjoy* physics, start here.
4. **We Have No Idea — Whiteson & Cham**  
   Popular science tour of open problems in physics.

## Math
1. **IIT Mathematics for JEE — Khanna, Sharma, Pundir**  
   Huge problem set that sets you up for Advanced.
2. **Plane Trigonometry (Part 1) — Loney**  
   Trains geometric intuition and visualization.
3. **What is Mathematics? — Courant & Robbins**  
   A deep tour far beyond JEE, worth it if you’re serious about math.
4. **Proofs from THE BOOK — Aigner & Ziegler**  
   For the truly math-obsessed. Pure gems.

## Chemistry
1. **Atkins’ Physical Chemistry — Atkins & Paula**  
   Physical chemistry is way more fun when you see the quantum foundations.
2. **Organic Chemistry — Morrison & Boyd**  
   If you love organic, this is a deep dive.
3. **Concise Inorganic Chemistry — J.D. Lee**  
   A good taste of the intricacy of inorganic.
