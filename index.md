# Sushrut Thorat.

I am a cognitive scientist, ultimately interested in building resource-constrained artificial agents that can learn and function in the wild.

#### Current position:

* Postdoctoral researcher in Machine Learning.
    + At the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html), Osnabr√ºck University.
    + Advised by [Tim Kietzmann](https://www.kietzmannlab.org/lab/).
    + Institutional email address: [sthorat@uos.de](mailto:sthorat@uos.de)
* Research interests:
    + Iterative refinement of object identity inference in recurrent neural networks.
    + Lifelong learning on continuous data streams with recurrent neural networks.
    + Interactions between memory, perception, and decision-making systems.
    + Bio-inspired local learning rules as alternatives to backpropagation-based updates.

#### Previous education/experience:

* PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21214391.v1)) from the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/), Radboud University.
* MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5919154.v1)) from [CIMeC](https://web.unitn.it/en/cimec "Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences"), University of Trento.
* BTech in Engineering Physics ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1582657.v2)) from [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). <br>

Further academically-relevant information can be found in my curriculum vitae ([full]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-full.pdf)/[short]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-short.pdf)). I am currently working on projects related to my research interests. The [projects page]({{site.url}}/projects/) contains brief summaries of my projects. A list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=MPFzJQgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Beyond research, I enjoy playing League of Legends, Age of Empires 2, badminton, and board games (Catan <3). I am always up for water-sports: swimming, kayaking, snorkelling, stand-up paddling, and scuba diving. Also sign me up for any adrenaline-pumping, motivating, or tear-jerking anime (have you watched Hunter x Hunter yet? Your Lie in April?), or movies!

I occasionally blog about the green screens of my projects, half-baked but interesting ideas, and other random stuff which might come in handy.

<!-- I occasionally (mostly used to) write short stories and poems (I am a novice). They can be found at [Meadows](https://novelmartiswrites.wordpress.com). -->
