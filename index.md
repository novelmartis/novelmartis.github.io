# Sushrut Thorat.

I am a cognitive scientist, aiming to build resource-constrained artificial agents that can learn and function in the wild.

#### Current position:

* Postdoctoral researcher in Machine Learning.
    + At the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html), Osnabr√ºck University.
    + Advised by [Tim Kietzmann](https://www.kietzmannlab.org/lab/).
    + Institutional email address: [sthorat@uos.de](mailto:sthorat@uos.de)
* Research interests:
    + Computational/normative models of visual relations.
    + Image processing with recurrent neural networks.
    + Lifelong learning on continuous data streams.
    + Interactions between memory, perception, and decision-making systems.
    + Developmental perspectives on learning.

#### Previous education/experience:

* PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21214391.v1)) from the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/), Radboud University.
* MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5919154.v1)) from [CIMeC](https://web.unitn.it/en/cimec "Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences"), University of Trento.
* BTech in Engineering Physics ([thesis](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1582657.v2)) from [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). <br>

Further academically-relevant information can be found in my [curriculum vitae]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-full.pdf). The [projects page]({{site.url}}/projects/) lists and briefly summarizes my projects.

Beyond research, I enjoy playing League of Legends, Age of Empires 2, badminton, and board games (Pandemic, Catan <3). I am always up for water-sports: swimming, kayaking, snorkelling, stand-up paddling, and scuba diving. Also sign me up for any adrenaline-pumping, motivating, or tear-jerking anime (have you watched Hunter x Hunter yet? Your Lie in April?), or movies (Notting Hill/Star Trek-esque)!

I occasionally blog about the green screens of my projects, half-baked but interesting ideas, and other random stuff which might come in handy. I used to (now very rarely do) write short stories and poems. They can be found at [Meadows](https://novelmartiswrites.wordpress.com).
