# Sushrut Thorat.

I am a cognitive scientist as heart and a computational cognitive neuroscientist in practice. I am currently on a quest to understand how we can study the human brain to figure out the information processing underlying certain visual cognitive processes. However, in the future I plan to focus on building artificial cognitive systems, and only look at biological nervous systems for inspiration. In addition to the building blocks of open-domain artificial agents - knowledge representation, continual learning, memory encoding and retrieval, and theory of mind - I am also interested in the concepts of personal identity and subjective experience.

#### Current position:

* Doctoral candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience.
    + At the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/ "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour"), Radboud University.
    + Advised by [Marius Peelen](https://sites.google.com/site/peelenlab/lab-members).
* Doctoral research interests:
    + The nature and function of the attentional modulation of visual object processing.
    + Statistical and perceptual learning of distractor regularities in visual object detection - towards understanding the continuum between objects and scenes.
    + Why do mechanisms such as recurrence and reconstruction emerge in the visual system, and how would they help in machine learning?

#### Previous education/experience:

* MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from [CIMeC](https://web.unitn.it/en/cimec "Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences"), University of Trento.
* BTech in Engineering Physics from [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). <br>

Further academically-relevant information can be found in my curriculum vitae ([full]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-full.pdf)/[short]({{site.url}}/assets/cv-short.pdf)). I am currently working on projects related to my research interests. The [projects page]({{site.url}}/projects/) contains brief summaries of my past and current projects. My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=MPFzJQgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Beyond research, I enjoy playing League of Legends, Age of Empires 2, badminton, and board games (Catan <3). I am always up for water-related activities - swimming, kayaking, snorkelling, stand-up paddling, and scuba diving. Also sign me up for any adrenaline-pumping, motivating, or tear-jerking anime (have you watched Hunter x Hunter yet? Your Lie in April?) or movies!

<!-- I occasionally blog about the green screens of my projects, half-baked but interesting ideas, and other random stuff which might come in handy. -->

<!-- I occasionally (mostly used to) write short stories and poems (I am a novice). They can be found at [Meadows](https://novelmartiswrites.wordpress.com). -->
